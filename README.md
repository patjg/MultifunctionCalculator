# SimpleStatisticsCalculator

    A multifunctional calculator that will build on a growing library of simplified mathematical functions built in C++. Will include statistics functionality and basic calculator functions, but will also include algebraic functionality that can simplify algebraic expressions and a converter that will allow for changing of numbers to various base number systems. 
    
    
  
    Note that this is my first semi-large scale project. I appreciate any feedback you may have. I know there will be a lot of improvements to be made, and I plan to keep updatting this as I progress in my ability to program.
